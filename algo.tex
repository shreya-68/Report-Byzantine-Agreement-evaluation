Here, we will describe the model of the network, adversarial conditions and the algorithms of \cite{BPV06}, \cite{BGH13} and \cite{KM13}, i.e., algorithm \textit{Quorum}, \textit{Pull-Push} and \textit{EIG}, respectively, that are to be evaluated under these conditions. Table 1 compares key properties of these algorithms.


\subsection{Model}
Our model is a \textit{fully-connected} network of $n$ processes, with authenticated communication channels---the identity of the sender is known to the recipient and authentication is not required during the execution of the protocol. We require the network to be \textit{reliable}, i.e., a message sent (to a non-faulty process) will eventually be delivered and in order. Per Section~\ref{sec:background}, we consider only the \textit{synchronous} model of communication. In this setting, the communication proceeds in rounds and all processes have synchronized clocks; a process moves on to the next round after all the processes have completed the previous round. %messages are all sent out at the same time at the start of the round, and then received at the same time at the end of the same round. 

\subsection{Adversary}
The adversary controls a fraction of the processes---a maximum of $k$ processes, which are called \textit{byzantine} processes. Such processes deviate arbitrarily from the algorithm by crash failures or sending false messages. The assumption is that the adversary is \textit{non-adaptive} for all three algorithms, that is, the adversary chooses the set of byzantine processes at the start of the protocol. The adversary is computationally unbounded and has \textit{full information} about the state of all processes and the network, and the communication between any pair of them. Another characteristic is that the adversary is \textit{rushing}. This means that the adversary knows all the messages sent by the good processes in all the previous rounds and the current round before choosing which messages to send in the current round. This is also known as the \textit{full information} model \cite{GGL98}.

\subsection{Input String}
Both the algorithms \textit{Quorum} and \textit{Pull-Push}  make use of a string of bits as the final decision. However, algorithm \textit{EIG} uses a single bit as input and output decision value.


\subsection{Algorithms}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Quorum\cite{BPV06}}
The main result of this algorithm, due to Ben-Or et al., is as follows:
\begin{theorem}
For any constant $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a protocol $\mathcal{P}$ that reaches Byzantine Agreement in a synchronous full-information network tolerating $k < (1/4 - \epsilon) n$ non-adaptive Byzantine faults, and runs for expected $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ rounds. 
\hfill\qedsymbol
\end{theorem}
The algorithm makes use of a weaker version of broadcast known as \textit{Graded Broadcast} or \textit{Gradecast} \cite{FM97}, with a designated authority called the `dealer', who wants to broadcast a value $v$. At the end of the protocol, every process outputs a value and a number that denotes the confidence of the process in that value. If the dealer is honest, every honest process outputs the same value with full confidence. 

The quorum protocol proceeds in stages. It makes use of Feige's protocol \cite{Feige99} for collective coin-flipping which works as follows: in the first round, all the processes throw a ball at random into one of $O(n/log\;n)$ bins. The processes which throw their ball into the \textit{lightest bin} (bin with least number of balls) survive. The protocol is invoked recursively on the $O(log\;n)$ processes in the lightest bin. Agreement on the lightest bin is achieved by running \textit{sub-protocols} among every subset of processes of size $\frac{3}{4}\log n$. These sub-protocols can be executed in parallel since the decision of one does not affect the other.

The key idea is that honest processes are unbiased and the resulting bin will contain a large fraction of honest processes. After $log^* n$ invocations of the process, a leader is elected. The leader then flips a coin, and broadcasts it, which is the agreed value. The challenge is that dishonest processes will exhibit byzantine behavior when throwing their ball into one of the bins by sending conflicting values to different processes. This is overcome by using the \textit{gradecast} protocol described earlier. 

\subsubsection{Algorithm Pull-Push \cite{BGH13}}
This algorithm by Braud-Santoni et al. \cite{BGH13} is the first probabilistic Byzantine Agreement algorithm whose communication and round complexities are poly-logarithmic. The authors use the almost-everywhere algorithm by King et al.~\cite{KSSV06} and extend the protocol to Byzantine agreement in the complete network. This protocol uses the \textit{pull-push} communication model. The following theorem shows the main result: 


\begin{theorem}
For $n$ processes in an asynchronous full-information message passing model with a non-adaptive Byzantine adversary which controls less than a $1/3 - \epsilon$ fraction of the processes, if more than $3/4$ of the processes know a string $g_{\mathtt{string}}$ (random enough), there is an algorithm such that with high probability:
\begin{itemize}
\item At the end of the algorithm, each correct process knows $g_{\mathtt{string}}$.
\item The algorithm takes $O(\frac{\log n}{log \; \log n})$ rounds and $\tilde{O}(n)$ messages are exchanged in total. 
\hfill\qedsymbol
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

The algorithm makes use of \textit{quorums} to filter requests or messages sent by other processes. The choice of quorums each process uses is directed by both deterministically-known information (like the identity of the process), and random sources (randomly chosen initial string). Such quorums are called \textit{Samplers}.


Each process starts with a candidate string (the string to be agreed upon). The assumption is that more than half of the processes are both correct and have the same candidate string. The algorithm proceeds in two phases. In each of the phases, messages are sent only to selectively chosen processes or are received from selectively chosen processes by sampler functions.

\textbf{Push Phase:} In the first phase, each process starts to \textit{diffuse} (send) its candidate string $g_{\mathtt{string}}$. A push occurs when a process receives information about their candidate string from other processes without asking for it. To each pair of string $s$ and process $x$, the push quorum $I(x,s)$ assigns a set of $O(log\;n)$ processes. $x$ may receive pushes for $s$ from processes in $I(x,s)$ only. If more than half of the processes of $I(x,s)$ push for $s$, $s$ is added to $x$'s candidate list $L_x$. 
We refer the reader to Algorithm \ref{alg:push} in the Appendix for details.
 
\textbf{Pull Phase:} In the second phase, called the pull phase, the bogus strings are discarded so that each process keeps only the correct string. This is done by each process requesting the strings it received in the push phase to be verified by some other processes. A \textit{pull} query is sent out to receive information about each string as a consequence. Checking a string $s$ involves a Poll List $J(x, r_x)$ and a Pull Quorum $H(x, s)$, where $r_x$ is chosen at random. 
Algorithms \ref{alg:send_pull}, \ref{alg:rout_pull} and \ref{alg:ans_pull} in the Appendix give a detailed implementation of the sending, routing and answering of pull requests.

\subsubsection{Algorithm EIG \cite{KM13}}
This protocol, similar to the classic protocol by Bar-Noy et al.~\cite{Bar-NoyD91}, has two phases. In the first phase, each process communicates with every other process for $k + 1$ rounds and stores the collected information in each round at a corresponding level in a tree-like data structure. In the second phase, a bottom-up evaluation is done on each of the trees at each process. The fundamental difference between this protocol and past EIG solutions is that after a couple of rounds, instead of storing and sending proposed values at each level of the tree, only an array of suspected byzantine processes is sent. This array is updated after each round using what is known as the confirmation mechanism that works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item A process $p_i$ sends the \textit{main information} to every other process in round $r$.
\item At round $r+1$, process $p_j$ \textit{echoes} information received from $p_i$ in the previous round to every other process. 
\item If the main information received from $p_i$ in round $r$ is echoed by at least $(n - k)$ processes in round $r+1$, then process $p_j$ is said to \textit{confirm} the information received from $p_i$ in round $r$.
    \end{itemize}
%In round $1$ of the first phase, proposed values are sent to all other processes. In the second round, values received in the previous round are echoed to all other processes. Using the confirmation mechanism a byzantine list is created. In round $3$, the echoed messages from round $2$ are sent along with the byzantine list as the main information and the byzantine list is again updated. In the subsequent rounds, 
    The following is the description of the rounds $1$ to $k+1$ of the protocol: \\
    \textbf{Round 1} Each process sends its proposed value to all other processes. $\mathtt{val(x)}$ is set to the received value $v$ from process $x$ where $\mathtt{val}$ is a variable of nodes at level $1$ of the EIG tree. \\
    \textbf{Round 2} Each process echoes the messages received in the first round. The received messages are set as the value of variable $\mathtt{cval}$ of nodes at level $2$. For a node $x = jk$, $\mathtt{cval(x)} = v$ where $v$ is the value that process $p_k$ reports that it received from $p_j$ in the previous round. The confirmation mechanism is applied to the received echoed messages by each process $p_i$. The process whose main information is not confirmed in this round is added to $p_i$'s byzantine list. \\
    \textbf{Round 3} The echo messages received in round $2$ are sent as echo messages again. The suspected byzantine list is sent as the main information. Confirmation mechanism is applied to the echoed information and the byzantine list is updated in each round from here on. \\
    \textbf{Round r, ($4 \leq r \leq k+1$)} From the 4th round onwards, the suspected byzantine list of a process is sent as its main information and byzantine lists received in the previous round are echoed. Nodes at corresponding levels of the EIG tree from round 3 onwards, for each process $p_i$, are given values for $\mathtt{val}$ and $\mathtt{cval}$ as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For node $x=ykl$, $\mathtt{val(x)} = \top$, if $p_l$ never reported to $p_i$ by round $k$ that it suspects $p_k$, else $\mathtt{val(x)} = \bot$.
        \item For node $x=yjkl$, $\mathtt{cval(x)} = \top$, if $p_l$ never reported to $p_i$ by round $k+1$ that $p_k$ suspects $p_j$, else $\mathtt{cval(x)} = \bot$.
        \item For leaf nodes $x = ykl$, $\mathtt{val(x)} = \top$, if $p_l$ did not report to $p_i$ that it suspects $p_k$, else $\mathtt{val(x)} = \bot$.
    \end{itemize}
where $y$ is a string of ids (possibly empty), and $j, k, l$ are ids of three different processes.

 An important point to note here is that in every round even though the number of nodes in the EIG tree increases by factor $n$, the new information received remains quadratic which allows us to use arrays to store this information. Even the size of the echoed messages remains quadratic in every round. 

 \textbf{Extracting the final information:}\\
Starting from the leaves, the nodes of the EIG tree are evaluated bottom-up as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $x$ is a leaf, $\mathtt{newval}(x) \leftarrow \mathtt{val}(x)$.
    \item if $x$ is root, $\mathtt{newval}(x) \leftarrow v$ such that strict majority of new values of its children are set to $v$, otherwise it is set to default value $v_0$.
    \item otherwise, $\mathtt{newval}(x) \leftarrow v$ if for $T = \{y \mid y \text{ child of } x \wedge \mathtt{newval}(y) = \top\}$, $\mid T \mid \geq (n-t-l)$, and a strict majority of nodes in $T$ have $\mathtt{cval}$ set to $v$.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Algorithm ImprovedEIG}
\label{sec:modEIG}
        We modify the \textit{EIG} protocol slightly to require that
        instead of sending the complete byzantine list every time, from round
        $4$ onwards only the changes to this list be sent in every round. We
        are motivated to do so since sending information about the existence of
        a process in the suspected byzantine list of another process in every
        round is redundant. This does not change the correctness of the
        algorithm since all the good processes send the same changes to every
        other process in a round and in the next round the confirmation
        mechanism would confirm these updated lists.  The rest of the algorithm
        is identical to algorithm \textit{EIG}.  This means that the number of
        rounds required to reach consensus remains unchanged as the information
        every process has about the suspected byzantine list of another process
        at the end of a round is the same as in algorithm \textit{EIG}. This
        implies that the round complexity is unchanged, and therefore the
        latency of the algorithm is unaffected.
