\subsection{Algorithm Quorum\cite{BPV06}}

\begin{definition}
A protocol $P$ is said to achieve graded broadcast if, at the beginning of the protocol the dealer $D$ holds a value $v$, and at the end of the protocol, every process $P_i$ outputs a pair $(v_i, c_i)$ where $c_i \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ denotes the confidence of the process in value $v_i$. With that, the following properties should hold:
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $D$ is honest, then $v_i = v$ and $c_i = 2$ for every honest process $P_i$. 
\item For any two honest processes $P_i$ and $P_j$, $\mid c_i - c_j \mid \leq 1$.
\item (Consistency) For any two honest processes $P_i$ and $P_j$, if $c_i > 0$ and $c_j > 0$, then $v_i = v_j$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The graded broadcast algorithm is described in detail as follows: \\
\textbf{Input to the Dealer $D$:} A value $v$  \\
\textbf{Output of process $P_i$:} A pair $(v_i, c_i)$ \\
\textbf{Step 1} The dealer $D$ distributes $v$ to all the processes. \\
\textbf{Step 2} (For every process $P_i$) Send $v_i$, the received value from the dealer, to all other processes.  \\
\textbf{Step 3} (For every process $P_j$) Let $v_i^j$ denote the message from process $P_i$ in Step 2. If there is a value $\mu$ such that $\geq n - k$ of the $v_i^j$'s are equal to $\mu$, then send $\mu$ to all the processes. Else, send $\bot$. \\
\textbf{Step 4} (For every process $P_i$) Let $\mathtt{num}_\mu$ denote the number of players that sent $\mu$ to $P_i$ in Step 3. \\
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\mathtt{num}_\mu \geq 2k + 1$ for some $\mu$, output $(\mu, 2)$.
\item If $2k \geq \mathtt{num}_\mu \geq k + 1$ for some $\mu$, output $(\mu, 1)$.
\item If $\mathtt{num}_\mu \leq k $ for all $\mu$, output $(\bot, 0)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm Pull-Push \cite{BGH13}}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Sending Queries: Each node $x$ verifies each string $s \in L_x$ by polling a set of nodes. A random string $r_{x,s}$ is chosen to define $J(x, r_{x,s})$. A different random string is used for each candidate string $s$. Next, $x$ sends a `POLL' request to Poll List $J(x, r_{x,s})$ and a `PULL' request to Push Quorum $H(x, s)$.
%\item Answering: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item A node $y \in H(x, s)$ forwards a request received from $x$ iff $s$ is its initial candidate string $s_y$. The request is forwarded to nodes in $J(x, r_x)$ routed through their Pull Quorums by sending a `ROUTE' request.
%\item A node $z$ in the Pull Quorum of $w \in J(x, R_x)$ ($z \in H(s, w)$) forwards the request to $w$ iff $s = s_z$ and $z$ received the request from more than half of the nodes of $H(x, s)$. 
%\item Finally, a node $w \in J(x, r_x)$ replies to a `PULL' request from $x$ if:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item the pull request was received from a majority of $H(w, s)$;
%\item either one of its pull requests was answered (thus $w$ knows $g_{\mathtt{string}}$), and $s_w$ was changed accordingly;
%\item or it currently has received less than $log^2n$ pull requests. 
%\end{itemize}
%\end{enumerate}
%\item Deciding: If $x$ receives answers from a majority of nodes in $J(x, r_{x,s})$, $s$ is deemed to be the global string.
%\end{enumerate}
